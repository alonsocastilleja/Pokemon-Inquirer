# Pokemon-Inquirer App

I built a Pokemon application !

## Getting Started 

Run the 'npm i' in your command line tool in order to install all of the dependencies.

## Running the App

In order to start running the app, you need to type 'node pokemon' in the command line tool which runs the pokemon.js file.

## Stopping the App

In order to force the server to stop running, you can tap the  'Control' and 'C' keys on your command line tool simultaneously.

## Built With
